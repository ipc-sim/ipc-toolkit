We provide Python bindings for functions in the toolkit using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).

## Installation

To install the latest release, you can use `pip`:

```
pip install ipctk
```

If you wish to install the current development code, you can compile the library from scratch. Either clone the [repo](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit) manually or use `git+` with `pip`:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit
```

## Build

To manually build the python binding you can either use the `setup.py` script or use `cmake` directly. The easiest way is to use the `setup.py` script which uses `setuptools`. To do this, use the following command from the root of the repository:

```sh
pip install .
```

This will build the library and install them on your system.

You can test that the installation was successful by doing
```sh
python -c "import ipctk"
```

### CMake Build

Alternatively, you can use `cmake` directly. To do this, use the following commands from the root of the repository:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DIPC_TOOLKIT_BUILD_PYTHON=ON ..
make -j4
```
