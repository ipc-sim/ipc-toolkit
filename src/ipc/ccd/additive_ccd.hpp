// NOTE: These methods are provided for reference comparison with [Li et al.

// Tight Inclusion CCD, this CCD method is not provably conservative and so can
// potentially produce false negatives (i.e., miss collisions) due to
// floating-point rounding error. However, it is much faster than Tight
// Inclusion CCD (>100Ã—) and very robust due to the gaps and conservative
// rescaling used.
