## Description

IPC Toolkit is a set of reusable functions to integrate Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) into a simulation.

### Features

* IPC barrier function and its derivatives and adaptive barrier stiffness algorithm
* Broad-phase and narrow-phase continuous collision detection (CCD)
* Distance computation and derivatives between edges in 2D and triangles in 3D
* Distance barrier potential and its derivatives
* Smooth and lagged dissipative friction potential and its derivatives

### Limitations

This is not a full simulation library. As such it does not include any physics or solvers. For a full simulation implementation, we recommend [PolyFEM](https://polyfem.github.io/) (a finite element library) or [Rigid IPC](https://github.com/ipc-sim/rigid-ipc) (rigid-body dynamics) both of which utilize the IPC Toolkit.

## Installation

To install the latest release, you can use `pip`:

```
pip install ipctk
```

If you wish to install the current development code, you can compile the library from scratch. Either clone the [repo](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit) manually or use `git+` with `pip`:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit
```

## Help/Documentation

* A tutorial on how to use the toolkit can be found [here](https://ipc-sim.github.io/ipc-toolkit/tutorial/getting_started.html).
* A function reference can be found [here](https://ipc-sim.github.io/ipc-toolkit/python.html).

## Contributing
