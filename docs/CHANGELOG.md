# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v1.1.1 (Aug 18, 2023)

* Logo by @zfergus in [#52](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/52)
* Fix vertex-vertex `==` and `<` functions to be order independent
    * This allows vertex-vertex constraints merge correctly
* Update Tight Inclusion CCD

## v1.1.0 (Jul 25, 2023)

Large refactoring to make the code more object-oriented rather than passing objects to functions. Other changes include the friction potential now being a function of velocity, bug fixes, and a new tutorial.

### Details

* Large Refactor in [#25](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/25)
    * `construct_collision_candidates(..., candidates)` -> `candidates.build(...)`
    * `is_step_collision_free(candidates, ...)` -> `candidates.is_step_collision_free(...)`
    * `compute_collision_free_stepsize(candidates, ...)` -> `candidates.compute_collision_free_stepsize(...)`
    * `compute_barrier_potential*(constraints, ...)` -> `constraints.compute_potential*(...)`
    * `compute_shape_derivative(constraints, ...)` -> `constraints.compute_shape_derivative(...)`
    * `compute_minimum_distance(constraints, ...)` -> `constraints.compute_minimum_distance(...)`
    * `construct_friction_constraint_set(..., friction_constraints)` -> `friction_constraints.build(...)`
    * `compute_friction_*(..., friction_constraints, ...)` -> `friction_constraints.compute_*(...)`
    * Generic `CollisionStencil` parent class to `Candidates`, `CollisionConstraints`, and `FrictionConstraints`.
    * Renamed `Constraints` to `CollisionConstraints`
    * Replaced single letter variable names `V`, `E`, `F` with `vertices`/`positions`, `edges`, `faces`
    * Renamed `*_index` -> `*_id`
    * Replaced `inflation_radius = min_distance / 1.99` with `inflation_radius = min_distance / 2` and use rounding mode to conservativly inflate AABBs
    * `CollisionConstraints::use_convergent_formulation` and `are_shape_derivatives_enabled` must now be accessed through getter and setter functions
    * Friction potentials are now functions of velocity. Previously `V0` and `V1` were passed and `U = V1-V0`. This limited the integration scheme to implicit Euler. Upstream this means you need to multiply the potential by `1/(dv/dx)` to get the correct friction force.
        * Change input $\epsilon_vh$ to $\epsilon_v$ in [#37](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/37) to reflect the fact that friction is defined in terms of velocity instead of displacement now.
* Changed default `project_hessian_to_psd` to `false` in [#30](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/30)
* Update website with a tutorial ([#31](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/31)) and version dropdown list ([#34](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/34))
* Switch from templates to using `Eigen::Ref` in [#28](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/28)
* Speed up the CCD by limiting the maximum minimum distance to `1e-4` in [#43](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/43)
* Fix the bug pointed out in [#41](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/41) in [#42](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/42). Namely, to get units of distance in the barrier we should divide the original function by $\hat{d}\cdot(\hat{d} + 2d_{\min})^2$ when using distance squared. Before it was being divided by $2d_{\min} \hat{d} + \hat{d}^2$.
* Fix build for IPC_TOOLKIT_WITH_CORRECT_CCD=OFF in [#44](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/44)
* Switched from FetchContent to CPM in [#48](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/48). This provides better caching between builds. Additionally, made robin-map and Abseil optional dependencies.
* Add the CFL-Inspired Culling of CCD as described in Section 3 of the Technical Supplement to IPC in [#50](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/50)

## v1.0.0 (Feb 21, 2023)

This is the first official release. ðŸš€

This is a stable release of the toolkit prior to refactoring the code and making updates to the API.

### Details

* Added a minimum distance optional parameter to all CCD functions (`const double min_distance = 0.0`) in [#22](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/22). This is placed as the first optional argument which can break calling code if optional parameters were previously used.
* Added `CollisionMesh` in [#7](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/pull/7) to wrap up face and edges into a single data structure.
    * Removes Support for ignoring internal vertices. Instead, users should use the CollisionMesh to map from the full mesh to the surface mesh.
    * This also includes a `to_full_dof` function that can map the reduced gradient/hessian to the full mesh's DOF.

#### Added
* voxel_size_heuristic.cpp which suggests a good voxel size for the SpatialHash and HashGrid

#### Changed
* Changed HashGrid voxel size to be the average edge length not considering displacement length. This results in better performance, but can result in large memory usage.

### 2021-04-29 ([293d0ad](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/293d0ad992c01df561e25c286043c9ae9b901ff0))

* Switched to the correct (conservative) CCD of [[Wang and Ferguson et al. 2020]](https://continuous-collision-detection.github.io/)
    * Can select Etienne Vouga's CCD in the CMake (see README.md)

### 2021-02-01 ([b510253](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/b51025310223b487e7c39858265d8d5c3e8b1e8a))
#### Added
* Added minimum seperation distance (thickness) to distance constraints
    * Based on [Codimensional Incremental Potential Contact [Li et al. 2020]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04457)

### 2021-02-01 ([a395175](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/a3951750ca5f167ab1d546ae1dadd87d0a9e2497))

### 2021-01-12 ([deee6d0](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/deee6d0f9802910c5565f800492f9a995e65cf7e))
#### Added
* Added and optional parameter `F2E` to `construct_constraint_set()`. This is similar to `F` (which maps faces to vertices), but maps faces to edges. This is optional, but recommended for better performance. If not provided a simple linear search will be done per face edge!
    * TODO: Add a function to compute this mapping.

### 2021-01-09 ([deee6d0](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/deee6d0f9802910c5565f800492f9a995e65cf7e))

#### Changed
* Removed TBB parallelization form the hash grid because we get better performance without it.
   * TODO: Improve parallelization in the hash grid or switch to the original IPC spatial hash

### 2020-11-06 ([4553509](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/4553509fe6a4e6b78c041018cd6db3fdf23b4730))
#### Fixed
* Fixed multiplicity for point-triangle distance computation to avoid duplicate point-point and point-edge pairs.

### 2020-10-22 ([51f4903](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/51f49030dbeec15a6a7544826f5531811a779402))
#### Fixed
* Projection of the hessian to PSD. This was completely broken as the projected matrix was never used.

### 2020-10-22 ([9be6c0f](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/9be6c0f7e2534e426e3f09f4c547406d50d5cf9c))
#### Fixed
* Mollification of EE constraints that have a distance type of PP or PE
* If there is no mollification needed then the PP and PE constraints are stored with multiplicity
* Set the parallel EE friction constraint threshold to eps_x like in IPC
    * This avoid needing the mollification for the normal force and these forces are small anyways

### 2020-10-10 ([cb8b53f](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/cb8b53fb098598ba5e8c95d4bdb4730e8df9382e))

### 2020-10-07 ([5582582](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/5582582bc2f54464bfcee4ba0ec2b7e6975f596f))
#### Added
* `FrictionConstraint` structures to store friction information (i.e., tangent basis, normal force magnitude, closest points, and coefficient of friction)
* Unit test that compares the original IPC code's friction components with the toolkit's

#### Changed
* `compute_friction_bases()` is now `construct_friction_constraint_set()`
    * It now takes the coefficient of friction (`mu`)
    * It now puts all information inside of the `FrictionConstraints` (`friction_constraint_set`)

### 2020-10-06 ([b48ba0e](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/b48ba0ec9d60754e7670e28fd1987b0c78cd809f))

#### Changed
* During `construct_constraint_set()` the constraints are added based on distance type
    * Duplicate vertex-vertex and edge-vertex constraints are handled by a multiplicity multiplier
    * Edge-edge constraints are always line-line distances
    * Point-triangle constraints are always point-plane distances

### 2020-10-05 ([9a4576b](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/9a4576b209302c79296593ac213ed8ce85510f3b))

#### Fixed

#### Changed
* Headers are now include with the prefix `ipc/`
    * E.g., `#include <ipc.hpp>` â†’ `#include <ipc/ipc.hpp>`


### 2020-09-04 ([7dd2ab7](https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/commit/7dd2ab7a255ffd23ccdfe5aee08bca6a142f75a7))

#### Added
* Collision constraint to store distance constraint pairs
    * `EdgeEdgeConstraint` stores the edge-edge mollifier threshold (`eps_x`)

#### Changed
