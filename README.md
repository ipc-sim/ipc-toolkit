## Description

IPC Toolkit is a set of reusable functions to integrate Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) into a simulation.

### Features

* IPC barrier function and its derivatives and adaptive barrier stiffness algorithm
* Broad-phase and narrow-phase continuous collision detection (CCD)
* Distance computation and derivatives between edges in 2D and triangles in 3D
* Distance barrier potential and its derivatives
* Smooth and lagged dissipative friction potential and its derivatives

### Limitations

This is not a full simulation library. As such it does not include any physics or solvers. For a full simulation implementation, we recommend [PolyFEM](https://polyfem.github.io/) (a finite element library) or [Rigid IPC](https://github.com/ipc-sim/rigid-ipc) (rigid-body dynamics) both of which utilize the IPC Toolkit.

## Build

The easiest way to add the toolkit to an existing CMake project is to download it through CMake.
CMake provides functionality for doing this called [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) (requires CMake ≥ 3.14).
We use this same process to download all external dependencies.

For example,

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    ipc_toolkit
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit.git
    GIT_TAG ${IPC_TOOLKIT_GIT_TAG}
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(ipc_toolkit)
```

where `IPC_TOOLKIT_GIT_TAG` is set to the version of the toolkit you want to use. This will download and add the toolkit to CMake. The toolkit can then be linked against using

```cmake
# Link against the IPC Toolkit
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ipc::toolkit)
```

where `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of your library/binary.

### Dependencies

**All required dependencies are downloaded through CMake** depending on the build options.

The following libraries are used in this project:

* [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/): linear algebra
* [libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl): basic geometry functions and predicates
* [oneTBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB): parallelism
* [Tight-Inclusion](https://github.com/Continuous-Collision-Detection/Tight-Inclusion): correct (conservative) CCD
* [SimpleBVH](https://github.com/ipc-sim/SimpleBVH): a simple bounding volume hierarchy data structure
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog): logging information

#### Optional

* [robin-map](https://github.com/Tessil/robin-map): faster hash set/map than `std::unordered_set`/`std::unordered_map`
    * Enable by using the CMake option `IPC_TOOLKIT_WITH_ROBIN_MAP`
    * Enabled by default
* [Abseil](https://abseil.io/): hashing utilities
    * Enable by using the CMake option `IPC_TOOLKIT_WITH_ABSEIL`
    * Enabled by default
* [filib](https://github.com/zfergus/filib): interval arithmetic for nonlinear trajectories/CCD
    * Enable by using the CMake option `IPC_TOOLKIT_WITH_FILIB`
    * Enabled by default
* [rational-cpp](https://github.io/zfergus/rational-cpp): rational arithmetic used for exact intersection checks
    * Enable by using the CMake option `IPC_TOOLKIT_WITH_RATIONAL_INTERSECTION`
    * Requires [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) to be installed at a system level
* [Etienne Vouga's Collision Detection Library](https://github.com/evouga/collisiondetection): inexact CCD
    * Included for comparison with the original IPC library
    * Enable by disabling the CMake option `IPC_TOOLKIT_WITH_CORRECT_CCD`
    * Replaces the default Tight-Inclusion CCD

## Usage

See the [tutorial](https://ipctk.xyz/tutorial/getting_started.html) for a quick introduction to the toolkit, or the [documentation](https://ipctk.xyz/cpp.html) for a full reference.

## Unit Tests

We provide unit tests to ensure the correctness of our algorithmic pieces.
To enable the unit tests use the CMake option `IPC_TOOLKIT_BUILD_UNIT_TESTS`.

### Dependencies

The following are downloaded when unit tests are enabled (`IPC_TOOLKIT_BUILD_TESTS`)

* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git): testing framework
* [finite-diff](https://github.com/zfergus/finite-diff): finite-difference comparisons
* [Nlohman's JSON library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json): loading test data from JSON files
