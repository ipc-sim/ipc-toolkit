**A set of reusable functions to integrate IPC into an existing simulation.**

For a complete list of changes, please see <a href="https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md"><code>CHANGELOG.md</code></a>, and for a definitive reference for these functions, please see the [IPC source code](https://github.com/ipc-sim/IPC).

## Integrating the IPC Toolkit into your project

#### 1. Add it to CMake

The easiest way to add the toolkit to an existing CMake project is to download it through CMake.
CMake provides functionality for doing this called [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) (requires CMake ≥ 3.14).
We use this same process to download all external dependencies.
For example,

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    ipc_toolkit
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ipc-sim/ipc-toolkit.git
    GIT_TAG ${IPC_TOOLKIT_GIT_TAG}
    GIT_SHALLOW TRUE
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(ipc_toolkit)
```

where `IPC_TOOLKIT_GIT_TAG` is set to the version of the toolkit you want to use. This will download and add the toolkit to CMake. The toolkit can then be linked against using

```cmake
# Link against the IPC Toolkit
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ipc::toolkit)
```

where `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of your project.

#### 2. Using the toolkit

The main functionality is provided in the `ipc.hpp` header. Use the prefix directory `ipc` to include all header files (e.g. `#include <ipc/ipc.hpp>`).

## Dependencies

**All dependancies are downloaded through CMake** depending on the build options.
The following libraries are used in this project:

* [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/): linear algebra
* [libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl): basic geometry functions and predicates
* [TBB](https://github.com/wjakob/tbb): parallelization
* [Tight Inclusion CCD](https://github.com/Continuous-Collision-Detection/Tight-Inclusion): correct (conservative) continuous collision detection between triangle meshes in 3D

### Optional

* [Etienne Vouga's Collision Detection Library](https://github.com/evouga/collisiondetection): continuous collision detection between triangle meshes in 3D
    * Enable by using the CMake flag `-DIPC_TOOLKIT_WITH_CORRECT_CCD=OFF`
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog): logging information (enabled by default)
    * Disable logging completely using the CMake flag `-DIPC_TOOLKIT_WITH_LOGGER=OFF`
* [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt): string formatting
    * This is either provided through spdlog or downloaded directly if logging is disabled (`-DIPC_TOOLKIT_WITH_LOGGER=OFF`)
* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git): testing (see [Unit Tests](#unit_tests))
* [finite-diff](https://github.com/zfergus/finite-diff): finite difference comparisons
    * Only used by the unit tests (if they are enabled)


## <a name="unit_tests"></a>Unit Tests

We provide unit tests for ensuring the correctness of our algorithmic pieces.
To enable the unit tests use the flag `-DIPC_TOOLKIT_BUILD_UNIT_TESTS=ON` with
CMake.
