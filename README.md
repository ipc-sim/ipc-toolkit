## Description

IPC Toolkit is a set of reusable functions to integrate Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) into a simulation.

### Features

* IPC barrier function and its derivatives and adaptive barrier stiffness algorithm
* Broad- and narrow-phase continuous collision detection (CCD) of linear and nonlinear trajectories
* Distance computation and derivatives between edges in 2D and triangles in 3D
* Distance barrier potential and its derivatives
* Smooth and lagged dissipative friction potential and its derivatives

### Limitations

This is not a full simulation library. As such it does not include any physics or solvers. For a full simulation implementation, we recommend [PolyFEM](https://polyfem.github.io/) (a finite element library) or [Rigid IPC](https://github.com/ipc-sim/rigid-ipc) (rigid-body dynamics) both of which utilize the IPC Toolkit.

## Build

Instruction for building and including the IPC Toolkit in your CMake project can be found on the website [here](https://ipctk.xyz/build.html).

### Dependencies

The IPC Toolkit depends on a handful of third-party libraries, which are used to provide various functionality.

**All required dependencies are downloaded through CMake** depending on the build options, and are built automatically when you build the IPC Toolkit. You do not need to install them separately.

A full list of dependencies can be found on the [dependencies page](https://ipctk.xyz/dependencies.html).

## Python Bindings

We provide Python bindings for functions in the toolkit using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).

For more information see the [Python documentation](https://ipctk.xyz/python.html).

## Usage

See the [tutorials](https://ipctk.xyz/tutorials/getting_started.html) for a quick introduction to the toolkit, or the [documentation](https://ipctk.xyz/cpp-api/potentials.html) for a full reference.

## Contributing
